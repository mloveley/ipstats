ipstats
=======

Command line tool to display ipv4/ipv6 throughput stats on OSX and Linux on the console
Where possible it displays separate stats for IPv4 and IPv6.
Testing shows it reports more accurate speeds than speedtest.net or similar web based speed test sites

Linux support is more limited due to less stats available in netstat, I had to use iptables to get any IPv4/IPv6 data.
Improvements/contibutions are welcome.
